Given an array ‘A’ of sorted integers and another non negative integer k, find if there exists 2 indices i and j such that A[i] - A[j] = k, i != j.

 Example: Input : 
    A : [1 3 5] 
    k : 4
 Output : YES as 5 - 1 = 4 
Return 0 / 1 ( 0 for false, 1 for true ) for this problem

Try doing this in less than linear space complexity.


## Solution

```cpp

```
